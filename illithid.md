Averaging around 7ft6inches in height, different skin tones varying from light blue to deep purple.  Large heads which contain sizable brains of an advanced nature.  They do have a mouth, however, it is hidden underneath 9 or more tentacles.  they are akin to humanoid squide creatures.

Strangers to this world, yes thats right.  World, not plane of existence!  They are a sentient race, much like our own humans, elves, dwarves ect ect.
