# Introduction to the empire of Elengal
The people of Elangal are a chaotic mix of different races.  all of whom were subjugated over the course of centuries by the relentless and highly adaptive humans that made up the bulk of its populous.  A people long cursed after desecrating the oldest pantheon to the gods of Varius.  Since its destruction, no one born in this empire has ever been gifted with magic.  those that dwell within and have such a gift have come from other lands.

Due to the lack of magic this empire substitutes the arcane with alchemy, advanced metal work and technical savvy.  The are the soul creators of steam powered mechanical constructs.  Famous for craft that rival even the ancient dragons of Daadendrian.  The empire of Elengal field a sizable fleet of air ships.  Galleon sized vessels designed to fly through the skies. 

They are currently the 2nd largest economic power on the island, rivalling the dragon born and their riders.  Their armies field new weapons, metallic and wooden thin barrelled weapons capable of firing projectiles as small as a grape at great velocity, dealing heavy amounts of damage. 

Very human centric, this empire has dominated and subjugated more than a dozen other races.  primarily among them are the goliaths Marag, the Kenku of Dunn and the Gnomes of Barlon.  each has the opportunities to gain station.  but they are hard earned.

They follow no gods and hold only to the ideal of progress and advancement.
