## How do people track time?
Time on the continent of Varius, and the world, is measured using the significance of the Gods.  Being twelve in number, it is a recurring theme in the history of the world, especially in Ferosian faiths.  The latter of whome recognise not one, but all of the gods and the marks they have left on the world.

the simple concept and recognition of the number repeats it self, sometimes in different ways.  

examples include - twelve days to a week (one) , thirtysix days to a month (three), and twelve months to a single year.

## The seasons change
Not all need to follow the same simplistic concept.  The seasons are such an exception.  Four different periods that each carry with them a level of temperature and growth.  Or such is the case with winter, death.
- spring is the longest of the seasons with four months of rebirth and the signaling of a new year of life.
- summer holds with three months to its cycle.  Giving the farmers and fishermen a decent chance to grow and harvest crops and build up their food stores.  The shortness of the season has made for very efficient methods of which to mass produce the maxmimum volume of crops to survive the lengthy year ahead.
- Autum, while the most beautiful of the seasons, is tragically the shortest.  Despite its time only consisting of two months of the year, the people do not mourn such a brief period.  The quickness of which Autum comes and goes is symbolic with life and death.  A demonstration that while something, or indeed someone, is beautiful and full of life. That it must someday come to an ened.  The importance of enjoying and appreciating that which is here now, but will one day be gone, is never lost.  Thus Autum holds the largest number of Religious holidays and ceremonies.
- winter is quick to arrive, and if one is not careful, devastating.  Winters, especially on Varius, are deadly affairs.  Snow comes faster than the dark grey clouds and rapidly plumeting temperatures, which herald its arrival.  Industry has helped fight back the unyeilding cruelty of the season.  It does not however stop some families, in particular, children from dying in their homes, huddled around their pitiful fires.
