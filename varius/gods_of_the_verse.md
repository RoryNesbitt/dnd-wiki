# Gods and the Mortal world - BY Greggor Kandark, Leader of the Elemvault sanctuary of solace.
## where are they?
Physically?  i dont think they really have a phyical form.  Not as we would know it anyway.  I believe they only take these humanoid forms to make us feel safe, to comfort us, or maybe our minds can only interpret them as humanoid.  I suspect if that were the case, then its to stop us from going insane.  Can anyone imagine what it must be like to see and know the very fabric of time and space just colours on a painting?  

They exist in forms and on planes of existence beyond our capabilities to reach or comprehend.  I fear mount celestia is the closest we will ever get to reaching their true glory. 

Solace as told in the ancient texts "the first steps", resides on a plane known as the sunset twilight.  A realm of never ending shallow water.  Scriptures tell us a sun from the east is always rising, while a sun from the west is always setting.  Those who are fortunate enough know there to be a rock pool where Solace greets the deciples of the hearth.  The others have their own realms from which to see and know.
## Who are they?
Without being condesending to my more honest and curious recipients of this tome, They are not of this world and yet exist as aspects of it in paradoxicle paradigm.  Solace is the sun that rises and sets, warms our skin, feeds our craps.  Amren is the sea and the winds that send the sails of our ships flying towards the horizon.  Without them, our world would not be.  They are artist, engineer, architect and farmer.   they are the very wind and sky.  

Abstract i know, but you should not expect any less.  They cannot be concieved by the human mind.  Our ways of thinking and how we percieve the world are far too Limited to understand who and what a god is.  Every time i hear some fool say they are a god, or intend to fight them, i cannot help but feel pity.  What is a mortal whos greatest creation will always be eclypsed by a being who can mold our world with nothing but a thought and will. 

To sumarise, they are everything we are, everything we can see, touch, taste, smell and hear.  They are here now with me and you as we share in this existence. 

## Are they friend, enemy, or something else?
They are none of these, and all of them at once.  They are our friend when we are at the height of happiness, and the very lowest in depression.  They are our enemy when we chose to name them so.  They are our begining and and salvation in our darkest hour. They have dwelt with us, walked with us and will walk with us on our final journey.
