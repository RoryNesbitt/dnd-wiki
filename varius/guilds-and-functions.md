## Thieves guilds 
- common organisations that have headquarters in every city and agents in every town.  They Preform a necessary service to the people by Balancing the scales of wealth between High lords and low born commoners.  Even kings and queens have been known to "encounter" them from time to time. 

## Hero's/adventurer's guilds 
- A realtively new construction in the city of Elem-vault.  this building was established by ageing warriors, mages, barbarians and kings, to teach a newer generation of hero's.  The time's where they are necessary come and go.  There knowledge however, they feel, is invaluable and thus they have hung up their mantels and weapons to take up the role's of teachers. 

## Necromancer enclave 
- The raising of the dead and the "experimentation" of them has often been a topic of contention in the eyes of the public and Wizard universities.  Still they traval the country side, tending the dead.....and raising them?  they have very different views on death and so created their own civilisation, where the dead outnumber the living but do not feast upon them. 
## Builders society 
- A group that, by comparison, is a very young and fortunate organisation.  Only formed over four hundred years ago, they came together when a number of strange and ancient precursor artefacts unearthed them selves.  strange metallic constructs identified by their common gold and copper sheen with perfectly crafted metal work.  little is known, except that they seem to predate even the elves and dragon wars from eons past.  This group has dedicated them selves to uncovering the mystery of these artefacts, and a large island which surfaced at the same time.

## Bankers 
- money makes the world go round.  As evil as they seem, they keep peoples money safe, invest it, make more money, increase economies and of course fund royal endeavours.  Without them, the world probably wouldn't work.

## Merchant guilds 
- Hey you!  You see that particular item over there?  Can you make more of it?  Do people want it?  Then have i got news for you!  If you can mass produce that item that people want, you can then sell it to them!  Depending on how much in demand they are, you can also charge them absurd prices.  If its traded, there is a particular branch of the guild that manages it.  The best friends of bankers and nobility everywhere.
