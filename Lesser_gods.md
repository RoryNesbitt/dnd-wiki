# The building blocks of creation
## the younger deities by Francine Bellflower, high priestess
Our world is a complex product of devine artistry.  A keen eye is needed to for a guiding hand to intricately piece together to internal fibres of the seeing eye.  The mind of one who has infinite knowledge must be consulted to craft a handle with the correct number of bones, tendens and blood vessels in a hand.  

These can be tiering tasks for only a handful of divine beings.  Like all living creatures, the desire to seek and create life is ever present.  From this came young and new deities to handle some of the minor aspects of our world.  

First, the twins, also better known and seen with the naked eye, the Moons.
- Grigo is the closer of the moons and helps us track the number of days there are to a week.
- Ciana is the further away moon who takes many shapes as the month's of our calander progresses. 
- Diebin, a lesser known god to the civilised and righteous of us.  Thieves and criminals are their deciples. 
- Veigo, seen as a matron of undomesticated Equines, and domesticated ones.  Giving humanity the gift of our greatest beast of burdons.
- Ekeksis, the god of victory.  Said to traval the earth in times of great conflict and found at the head of armies and leading them to victory and glory eternal
- Nebrixius, champion of loyalty, bonds, marriage and more.  One persons commitment to eachother can earn their favor and recieve great luck and happiness in life.
