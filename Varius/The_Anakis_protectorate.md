# Tiefling society, by Cirilla Talon - virtue name "Hope"
## Faith

It goes without saying, a society void of faith, is a society void of empathy, morality and purpose. The newly founded, as of the first of Vulmar in the year of sixty four - post colamity, tiefling nation is no exception. 

They follow three main domains of faith, though not all of them are connected to the devines.  
- **The Draconic Temple of strength**
contrary to popular belief, muscles are not the only example of strength known.  No rules or sacrifice other than holding to the larger principles of the five coure strengths the Great star molded their forms around.  "Strength of Will", "Strength of Heart", "Strength of mind", "Strength of Body" and lastly "Strength of soul".  Each species of dragon embodies at least one of these principles.  Without these strengths, the world is a cruel place indeed.  We tieflings know that better than anyone.

- **The Great Northern Star**
We in Ferosia of course know them as Solace, the elightened one, the hearth bearer, the Greeter and Lord of Growth. Those in our homeland would find it strange to learn that other cultures see and rever them differently.  Rest assured, they are still the sensible and kind God we know them to be.  They simply appeal to the needs of other races and cultures.  In the dragons, they inspire a strange sense of strong community bonds. Each dragon and dragonborn rally behind one another and create a great connection and forge umbreakable bonds of comradery.

- **Aegor - God of the ignored, the diposed and ostracized**
We are tieflings and so are the most ostracized species of all.  Not because of our nature, our skills, our religions and inate abilities.  We are thus because we simply exist.  True it may be, that our ancestry crossed paths with an unholy being from the darker realms of Tar'Val, and that is all anyone needs to purge us from existence. So why wouldnt we follow the vailed one?  The offspring of a Mortal, said to have been cast out for how undesirable and attractive, and The god of ends themself - Nhilus.  You need not visit a temple, pray at the side of a bed.  Simply walk the same path and they will bless you with the ability to remain hidden and undisturbed by the cruel people of the world.  Those whos minds are so filled with hate, bile and contempt for anything that strays from the norm.  Aegor has and will walk with us to our final days.  Society may abandon us, but they never will.

## Culture
Those who have come to live within the boarders of the Tiefling nation have known cruetly beyond measure. It is no question then why our society now favours the tennants of peace and conflict.  To reflect our desire to live and be free of prejudice and harm, but also our vow to meet any who would harm us without hesitation. 
- **Growth - the Tennants of peace** 

**Grow** - Not only does this mean to grow that which we will need to feed and cloth us, it also means to grow as an individual.  Ever do we walk the path of fate alone, and we will not always have someone to guid and protect us.  So we grow as a person in lessons paramount to our survival. 

**Reap** - Reap the rewards of dedication, patience and determination.  Whether its the seperation of the wheat from the chaft, or the newly found purpose and skill from endless hours of practice. 

**Offer** - we have lived our lives the way we saw fit, but we must never neglect those who will inherit the world after we are gone.  So we offer our skills, our knowledge to the young.  Never give bread to a starving mouth, but teach them to aqquire sustinance themselves, and they will never beg again.

**Work** - Dedicate your self to your work and labours.  Your actions will affect those around you in a positive or negative way.  Work hard not just for your self, but to inspire the members of your community to work harder as well. To create a better future for Tiefling kind. 

**Transform** - The land is like clay, the elders say.  It was be found, dug up, and molded into the desired shape.  We transform the land to meet the needs of all.  Houses to shelter us from the rain, fields ready to take the seeds that will blossom into the food we shall eat.  As we age and grow, we transform into something new each day and strive to be better than those who came before.

**Heal** - It goes without saying we who have travaled far and wide to reach this destination, have endured much hardship.  Our experiences will leave us paranoid, faithless, scarred and closed off to the world.  In these new lands we must heal,  The days of pain or over.  Now we become who we were always meant to be. 

- **Strike**

**Stand** -
