# Introduction
## People
### industrious and independant
Evident from the very moment I first stepped foot into the empire of elengal, is how each member acts and moves.  Watching the citizens of the city of StormsEye is much like watching the cogs, wheels and pully systems of a dwarven elevator mechanism, in one of their mines.  

They each move with common purpose.  To strengthen their position, that of their family and by extension their country.  A total opposite in regards to the three tennants of elven society.  Where they believe that if they are well, then they can help their families, and by doing so, help their empire.  One would think that was a deliberate way to structure their civilisation.  Even go as far as to say, much of what they do is done in such a way to spite their " lesser advanced neighbors" as they put it. 

A structured life if any there was one.  Out of the total eight day week, they work seven of those days and rest on one.  Each member of the populace maintains two or even three jobs at a time.  Diversifying the work environments with a constantly rotating workforce.  The second job it seems is always a less demanding one than the first.  This i believe is essential to maintain a never eausting work ethic.  

For example: A man or women would start their day working in the forge factories.  Come four hours after, they break for an hour to eat, drink and enjoy the sun.  Then they would spend time at a desk sifting through dirty cloths at a public laundry service station. A few hours after, repeat their break.  They don't always have to include eating and drinking.  Seeing friends.  Entertaining pets and so on.  Lastly, they could find them self infront of a room of people of all ages teaching them their letters and numbers.  

This constantly changing machine of people serves to uphold their principle's of hard work and good health.  Though more of the mind than the body it seems.  

### Enduring
consider that, almost seven hundred years ago, the people of Elengal were on the brink of extinction, they have done quite well for them selves.  Whatever ungodly act they commited is irellevant in my eyes compared to the breathtaking Empire they have created. 

Fantastical irrigation aqueduct technology which has allowed them to expand their borders from the Coast of the White sea, to the mountain barrier of Daardenria.  A polulation that was once a rediculous size to begin with at one hundred thousand people, now has reached an impressive
