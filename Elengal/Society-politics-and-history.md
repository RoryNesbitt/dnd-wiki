# History
## First Landing
Why would such a god forsaken people make a voyage for these lands, only to destroy that which is most sacred?  Is it curiosity perhaps?  The unrelenting urge felt by nearly all men and women, to seek out new lands and new people!  Perhaps it is for greed.  All  gold and steel mined from the earth they once called home and wasted!  Fields barren from being over farmed.  Streams, rivers and lakes dried up to sustain a population far to large and needy.  

Maybe they had heard the roumers of other Humans who had sailed from Gaia and now live in the heaven of the mortal realm?  their secrets are guarded well by their scholars and archaeloigists.  All we know is that they landed centuries after we did.  Since their arrival they have brought nought but all the wrongs of our kind.  They must have landed some time between the years of two hundred and twenty six and one hundred and ninty four pre colamity.  

The ships of a great kingdom of man, sigials bearing a mighty Storm bird, made landfall in the grey wastes far to the west.  The elves tell us that there was a time life life grew there in abdunance once.  However, dark powers claimed those lands, save for the ancient and oldest of all temples on Varius.  Mysterious it was that the gods laid watch over such a place, in conditions that not even the moust devout of followers would make a pilgramage.  

The humans of this foreign realm landed there all the same.  Some suspect it was the goddess Amren's idea of a cruel joke to send them there.  To a place where no life grows.  Bewildering of all was the fact that they managed to survive the storms that blanketed our coasts a week before.  One thousand ships they say made lanful that fateful day.  Too many to feed, water and clothe.  Their king at the time, Vinique Al Naaith, Was a warrior of rare quality. Most, if not all, of our historians attribute their success and survival to him and him alone.  Seven feet tall, as large as a barge and with Skin as fare and beautiful as the high elves of Gascade.  Or so the bards tales inform us.  

King Naaith Was the one who found the Pantheon of the gods.  No one quite knows what happend between the before and after.  Only that he used the power of the last storm bird that resided within, to destroy the temple.  With its foundations laid to waste, a spell was crafted and used that confounds mages across the continent to this day.  Whatever dark powers held control over those desolate were washed away with howling winds and strong rain.  

So sprung forth was a land of green and plenty.  Within a small number of years, the sands were turned into fields of grass, forrests and lush springs of cold fresh water.  His people believed him to be a god after such a feat.  Towns and cities were quickly constructed as they cemented their claim on great swaths of territory.  Securing their place as a military, political and economic power.

Varius was never the same after their achievments.  However, not for the reasons Elengal historians would have you believe.  For no one could have forseen, not even the mighty withces of Ferosia, the devistation that their sacriledge.  Nor the wrath of the gods that followed.  It wasnt a quick and decisive blow surprisingly.  Like a great poison that slowly rots away at the roots and core of a mighty oak tree.  A period of two hundred years was all it took for them to notice something was a foot.  Magic had slowly been driven from their people.  By the time they noticed, the damage had already been done.  

Dark ages are common phenomenon when civlisations rise too high and fall soo fast.  What frightens me the most is how Elengal never experienced one.  This suggests to me, the lords and even the kings of Elengal knew what was happening very near the beginning and prepared for the end.  Keeping it quiet is honestly one of their most admirable feats.  

What should have been their undoing, their dark age, as it were, turned into something unimaginable.  When magic began to fade, they compensated with automatons. Mechanisms were unveiled to accelerate the construction of fantastic and inspired archetecture. To this day i know not how they are powered and where the magic comes from for their metalic beasts and humanoids.  I see no other way that they could construct and control such machines without powers from the devines or other sources of parentage. 

In just four hundred years they had remade and redefined military stratagems with war machines that rival the gread dragons of Daadendria.  Galleon sized ships that sailed not the seas, but the skys them selves!  Weaapons that were as long as spears but hollow and with unholy smoke and explosions, they hurreled Small balls of lead that pierced shields, armour and flesh.  

Emboldened by their new found prowes, they set their sights on expanding their boarders to the west and south.  Three kingdoms belonging to three distinct races.  The kenkus of Dunn, the Goliaths of Barlon and the Aarakocra of Morag.  One by one they were given ultimatums from the now declared Emperess Valla Al Naaith.  "Surrender your crowns, stand down your armies and swear fealty to me, your new empress.  Do this without any bloodshed and I shall welcome you with open arms.  Resist, and those who are prideful, and refuse to bow down, shall be laid low and made unto dust".  

As any hostiran will tell you, though we offered sanctuary and refuge for those whom survived.  The Aarakocra were indeed prideful, and refused to bow down.  Fourty thousand they were once of twevle different distinct breeds.  Now there are but a few hundred and only three.  Empress Naaith was indeed generous to the Kenku and Goliaths  Going down in our history as The second colamity.  Given that she was born eight years after.  

Dadenria is still an impossible foe to engage in the skies and on the ground.  So what neighbors were there left for Elengal to conquer?  Ferosia wasn't save from her hunger and lust for conquest. Four centuries, it seemed, was enough to dull the memories of this hungry gluttonest beast.  They had forgotten how powerful an ally the weave of magic could be.

When she came to our boarders, she did not expect to be so fiercley resisted.  King James Arbourne, the first of his names, annointed by holy deeds and names.  The iron fist of Ferosia smashed the armies of Elengal on the land and sea with his own armies.  To the great ships of the skies he gave that responsibility to the witches.  

Beseaching the godess Amren of the seas and storms, solace the everlasting light.  The witches called down the rightious furry of the devines.  Leaving a lasting reminder that they were abandoned by the most powerful creatures you could hope to fight along side.  To this day, there is a lasting tension between our two peoples.  

Kanan Selencia, once brother to Kieran selencia, Father to Bran and grand father to Michael Selencia, holds the task as ambassador to the Empire of Elengal.  The silver snakes of Ferosia now are responsible for peaceful relations with an enemy who may have forgotten the power of magic, but never the Power of Ferosia.  Mira Save us all a place on the golden path Should the reason behind Elengal's power become clear.  and we're unable to protect against it.
