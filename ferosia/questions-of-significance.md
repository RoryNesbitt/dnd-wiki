# twelve days of sorrow, twelve days questions by Greggor seldar, Paladin of solace
## what happens when you die?
A question asked by possibly every single mortal in existance.  Ever since one was a little child, they feared the dark.  Deep down every beging knows that their life force will one day wither and fade.  However, we of the temples know that it is only our bodies that fade.  Our souls, to the best of our knowledge, are eternal and everlasting.  A gift from the goddess Mira herself.
