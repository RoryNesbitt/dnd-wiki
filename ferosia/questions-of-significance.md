# twelve days of sorrow, twelve days questions by Greggor seldar, Paladin of solace
## what happens when you die?
A question asked by possibly every single mortal in existance.  Ever since one was a little child, they feared the dark.  Deep down every beging knows that their life force will one day wither and fade.  However, we of the temples know that it is only our bodies that fade.  Our souls, to the best of our knowledge, are eternal and everlasting.  A gift from the goddess Mira herself.  

We know of many fates that await a soul upon release from their mortal coil.  
- First and most well known is the journey along the golden path of Mithris.  where upon completion of this journey, you will be welcomed into the plains of mount celestia itself.  To bask in peace and comfort forevermore. 
- second is a fate some might consider to be distasteful.  for if your soul is of many shades and colour, conjured by ones path through their life.  A sum total of their actions, deeds and choices.  They will find themselves before Rakdas.  the God of judgment.  If a soul could not be sent to a plane of its own, they would send them to one.
- last is a fate for only the most cruel, rotten, selfish and vile of mortal kind.  In ages past, when the gods were young, a great war was fought in the heavens.  A fortress realm would be constructed from which the angels of Martoof would rest and plan their battles.  Now we know it by a very specific name.  Hell.  A place of black rock, consumed by flames and unlife.  Where devils, corrupted celestial beings, now claim dominion.  Any soul that is as evil and cruel as these devils, will find them selves at their tables.  Forced to serve and fight till the very end of time it self. 

Of course we know that most do not share such a horrific fate.  Even the gods know that one must be judged by every other day of their life.  If we were all judged by our worst day.  We would all hang.  

Curious of all is the way that you take along the golden path towards pradise.  It is known amongst scholars, historians and mage folks alike, that you are required to answer twelve questions.  The significance of these is yet to be deciphered.  However, some theorise that they allow the godess Mira, who stands at each gate to welcome the souls of the dearly departed, to see into the hearts and minds of each soul and determine if they will be allowed in to her realm.  

The questions are as follows, but are not known if they are in a correct order. 

- What is your biggest regret?
simple enough to consider.  What is most important is to remember that the answer must be from their own perspective.  The action or moment they deem most regretable can give insight into the mind and reveal an aspect of their character. 
- From where, when, what or who, do you draw courage?  
Evident in this second question.  It is revealed why many maintain the theory that the questions, while simple to us, can reveal the true heart of those who answer.  I myself draw courage from sunlight.  Perhaps it is because, with it, life comes and grows.  Darkness is where death rests and comes for us all.  
- What to you, is love?
I am no philosopher my self, but shall analyse to the best of my ability. Love is an incredibly difficult concept to put into words.  It is a feeling that resides in all. I know of none my self who can describe what it is in its entirety.  What is love?  Maybe it is the face of the one you love?  The feeling of two hands intertwining.  A moment of silence, where the world and everything in it falls away, leaving that which cannot be spoken of, seen, but felt deep inside us. 
- In life, what did you live for? 
For every man or women.  There is a purpose that one may find or create for themself in their life.  No one can answer what the meaning of life is.  We can only make one of our own design.  I live for peace, community, and to right the wrongs of our past so we can move forward into the future.  
- What brought you joy in life?
