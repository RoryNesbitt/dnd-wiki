My real name given by my mother is Castor Star. And as she married Erdan Mellenye I am now Castor Star Mellenye

I have 2 elven siblings from the noble house of Mellenye after I became a paladin she wanted to have an heir and got twins and has moved into the new estate, leaving the old one in farmlands.

Matron Rotwood of the witch clan Rotwood is in charge of the temple of Solace where I reside with Klink and his homunculus Barry (gearwork owl)

## 24th of MarMun
Ask Rotwood or Suuma about a person in white cloak with draconian symbols from Daadendrain average 6ft-ish height

Cormac of the sapphire dragon riders is welcome in the temple of Solace as is his dragon companion Zho, he has seen battles and therefore is likeable in my eyes.

Orc chief (Gelcro) was wearing fancy clothing and asking Glen's (nice guy bit of an artist but prefers solders life) guardsmen about an advanced scroll

Mother Rotwood was murdered, place of death in temple garden, there was diluted water (possibly blood) on the arm of her chair, in there garden there were 3 sets of humanoid footprints and 1 was mechanical paw prints of heavy nature, body itself had 6 individual stabs 2 on front most on back, 4 slashes on the arms, small nick in back of her hand. Not local blade was sharp and fine, she was holding sacrificial knife probably in defence.

## 1st of SolMun
Brandon owner of the green mongoose Inn.

Sister Wind (a member of the witch coven) is taking charge until the next matron is chosen for the temple of Solace, so far I do not like her as I feel she is getting a little big for her boots and has little patience. The matron guard are now keeping watch over the temple under the watchful eye of Captain Asper who I have met in the past.

When asking Klink about the liquid on the armchair he told me that it is a needle shaped liquid and we are not sure what it might do to a witch.

Allan of the merchant guild is in the deals of endangered livestock. The dragon born have broken into his warehouse and were in the process of murdering him trying to find whatever it is they were looking for, Klink has stopped them initially with the help of a dark elf druid named Sebastian and I have gotten into the fray alongside Genevieve. At the moment I have been tangled in a spell and need to break out of it with strength.

2 other matrons, oak and maple are dead due to same poison that seems to be divine, Alan didn't tell us what the dragonborn are after and they were willing to kill each other to keep it secret.

Director General Eugene took me back to temple, I acted out of sister wind's orders which is getting me into a trial with the surviving matrons newt(main one), willow and avian, my guess is I am about to be stripped of my rank.

## 2nd of SolMun
Not stripped of paladin rank but instead of Knight I am paladin 3rd class

Dragonborn belong to the Hand of Almandine keep investigating on behalf of the court of princes

If we find more information we go to the dragonborn embassy led by a brass dragon

Investigated room 5 at green mongoose Inn

Secret orders from Ky a red dragon priestess garnet mountain orders to hunt down renegade band of dragonborn smuggling a relic but thee isn't one, you will know them by their white robes

During my rest I found myself on sort of golden clouds and there was a man by a golden pool which peered into other worlds it seemed, the man was my god solace and  when I questioned him on things he seemed uncertainly certain of various things, but the advice he gave helped give me perspective on others as well as gave me some confidence in what I was doing was right at least to myself, I offered him friendship and he asked me if I can figure out the meaning of "if you immediately  know that the candlelight is fire then the meal was probably cooked a long time ago" I said maybe by the time you figure something out it has probably already happened a long time ago, he said it was a plausible answer, I hope it helped, I also said I would try to sing tomorrow see if I was any  good at it

I sang as I walked the streets with everyone, I performed amazingly to the point of being adorned with flowers as I walked by, in some way I think this helped make me feel more happy than I was the other day.

Barry leads us to merchant area in Upper rings of the city and we have broken into a cellar and I did not witness it in case I am asked about my appearance there I was investigating a break in.

Under merchant building find room full or papers, some are business transactions, there are chests full of sea charts and one is full of women dragonborn clothing

Strange mark on wall chiselled image of a door
Symbol of Volsun (pleasure goddess) looking closer at symbol It starts to shimmer and the door forms out of the wall

Got ambushed in sewers after finding a box that heats up to create explosions, picked up 2 arrow pieces that hurt me it was fired by the dragonborn that broke into the warehouse, Allan came down asking after the box which we have smuggled away in Klinks armour and are making our way back out, Klink is investigating Allan's Manor

Cormac is hunting down the last red dragonborn, asked us to keep box safe, Genevieve went to the library for something, I suspect books, Klink, Seb and I went to a general goods shop to see about potions and in Klinks case gears to make a clock, I asked about getting a watch of a sorts but to no success and I was told to go to the bazaar for that, taking Seb with me while Klink is going to temple to work on things.

## 3rd of SolMun
Went to a bathhouse before going to the bazaar and getting more frustrated with Seb, tried being nice and just met with scorn now I'm just past caring, went to bazaar and got a dragon flute made of nice metals to be an apology to Genevieve, going to temple to ask about if he just wants to be independent and free of me as a father figure and to be his own bird.

Maybe I am trying too hard.. I just.. need to stop.. it's clearly not helping and I just need to stop.. I don't actually know what I am doing.. I was just going after small murders, I don't know how to go for a witch killing that clearly Klink and the others are doing far better than I am with, I disobeyed my order to spite a new witch cos I thought it might help, what do I know.. I'm an air genasi Paladin that can't follow orders.. so what do I become then?

Said my words to Klink (he snuck out the room and I didn't know) about how proud I am of him and he can do things independently if he wants and then seeked Ann-Marie from the library to get some help playing the flute, she helped and I tried to improvise a little and she gave me a parchment with music notes that I do not understand, I will ask Genevieve if she can help me with this

## 4th of SolMun
Genevieve tore up the music note and taught me one tune to play, I cannot read her at all when it comes to her moods

Cleric Jeremy continues to tease me and I am doing my best to fix anger and try not to punch him, I have been advised by Genevieve to take things less seriously and have more fun.

She has taken to eldritch blasting me anytime I act douchey towards anyone that doesn't deserve it, I have accepted this and went to see sister Wind alongside Jeremy being ready to escort her and after a time see Genevieve and Klink come back after experimenting with the box and they are brought in and the sister manages to open the box to reveal a golden egg which houses a golden dragon creature.

Zo (Cormacs dragon and Klinks friend) has come and asked who had it and we visited Alan and they shared a conversation in which Zo is going in the direction of the dragon embassy

## 5th of SolMun
Met with the leader of the embassy who was a brass dragon who essentially said the reason for losing the golden dragons through time was because they had a war for funsies and killed and massacred children and said it was no one's fault it was just in their nature, I went off on one after being in a war for essentially what was land and seeing the devastation first-hand and I don't see how he can sit there and feel OK with what happened considering we have a golden dragon child that we are being asked to hatch by the brass dragon Varym.

I have went to the Palace to assist with sister wind's escort and asked for clarity in what has happened with Alan and Varym and she has said I am right to be bothered but offered in better words the clarity in not understanding the nature of others is a set thing, I have spotted my mother in the crowd at a gazebo with an older gentleman who has the sigil of a fox surrounded by a moon.

As we were moving to the coronation sister Wind fell back slowly and took my hand whilst having eyes rolled back and misty eyes saying
"blood ash thorn red skies a house burning   sea of death." then returning to normal blue eyes she said "you must return to the temple strife."

Met with a silver dragonborn called Brienne and her dragon called Raya and they are giving me ride to temple, I owe them both a lovely meal.

Red haired elf with reptile eyes (possible dragon) past through saying "find the grove" so we should get there before they do if they aren't there already.

Found the dragon and he pointed to the tree for where the egg is thinking we would help him but he tried to hurt Klink so I swung for Degarra (the red dragon)

## 6th of SolMun
We made our way and purchased bedrolls and I took the night ride, we were attacked by bandits and have now eliminated all but 2 of them, we questioned the leader which was an elder lady

Klink was working on a sunroof for the carriage, we are now called the crimson gears, found out some things about Geoffrey

Spoke about my dad, definitely didn't feel comfortable, now reading a book on yuanti to forget the conversation, we are making our way into a port town to get a ferry to transport the golden egg far away as possible.

## 9th of SolMun
We have left horses with a man called Ezekiel and are about to enter the leaky tavern, I am about to perform with Genevieve and Geoffrey (man can play a lyre)

Performed decently well got a good sum of coin and ii felt quite good getting to sing and be rewarded for it, Genevieve is an amazing dancer but think I messed up her moves when having her dance in mid air, might ask if she would like to practice that if she would like to, though she might not, took me a while to move in the air when I did it as a lad haha.

Chatted with some sailors led by captain Gérard and he informed us of ship raids on fishing trips, we have offered assistance for their help in construction on carriage, discussing plans will go out in early morning.

Got some new armour sang and got attention of McAllister who is offering an audience with the governor if we deal with the fishing problem

## 10th of SolMun, Morning
On board of the green lady (the ship we are on and helping defend)
Having myself and three people on the front of the ship
Seb is with the captain and 2 others at the helm
Genevieve is up above and Klink and Geoffrey are sneaking onto the enemy ship when they arrive, Seb is setting traps so hopefully this will go off without a hitch.

## 10th of SolMun
We managed to eradicate the pirates and keep the 3 ships that attacked us, scrounged some rifles and ammo for them.

Helped one of the sailors get a bit of healing and Klink has taken us to port to await captain Gérard and the authorities believe us to be pirates on account of Klink shouting that we were, I and Seb are waiting for Gérard's return to prove we are not pirates, I asked them to let McAllister know we have dealt with the problem but unsure if they will let him know, one has went off for the moment but uncertain if they are attending to other matters.

We got McAllister and out of trouble, Seb has went off with Gérard to the leaky tavern to procure our reward for helping with the pirates and we are to meet with the governor tonight for our reward from him.

Heard some gunfire in the distance and seeing the boats heading to an area along the coast so riding with Seb to help with whatever is about to happen.

We fought off the pirates and they buggered off, returned a loaned horse and visited a magic shop with Genevieve and Sebastian, got myself a purple cloak to replace my tattered blue waist cloth and put the remaining cloak over my head, also purchased an owl mask to help for any disguises necessary, also might be good for parties.

Performed at the tavern again and it has been decided when at the governors I'm to do the talking.

Changed into my purple suit with dark blue shirt and white neck chief and frilly sleeves
Met with governor Mellemay

Got an amulet of health

Silens in Silverstone, possible bandits

Heard news that another witch has been killed which was mother newt.

Dinner went well but Klink is getting into a duel with the governor thankfully its to first cut. Genevieve made my tart taste like my favourite meal, lamb with heated butter and parsnips and salad, she has a gift, she is also chatting with Geoffrey and Seb and Klink quite a bit, wonder what I am doing.

Currently (heheh) reading some cookbooks beginning with cooking 101 to try and see about getting better food for everyone whilst we are on the road or just staying somewhere.

## 11th of SolMun
Dreamt of home.. seeing my mother reading she looks upset until my new father stepped in and she lit up and my siblings rushed over hugging them mostly focusing on their father.

Woke up and got food and now watching Klink fight the mayor, had conversations about my being too watchful of Klink and not letting him be his own person which led to me shouting that I wanted to be better than my father... I owe her an apology for that outburst.. she didn't deserve that.

Klink won the duel, I left without a word.. feel like I don't have the right words just now.. gonna get some supplies for our travel, see about some cooking stuff

Had a big talk with Genevieve and Sebastian about my.. issues and they have been able to help me process what I am doing and I'm working on trying to better myself for Klink..

We were attacked by a construct on the ferry, it hurt like a bitch and Klink and Sebastian knocked it off the boat but not before it hurt us quite a bit, Klink has saved Arthur Selens who is the first son and heir to the Selens House (one of the major 5 houses)

Swam down to see what the model and make of the construct was that was chasing after Arthur all I got was a insignia on its back in the form of a metal scorpion

Got some dills lemons and fennel and put them in carriage Seb is gonna help me with cooking, we are now approaching merchants bay and will speak with Sellyns mother about possible rewards.

We are making way east and around the mountains, Seb spoke with the horses somehow and left is actually Philip and right is actually Jeremy.

Dragon is following us we made camp for the night, made a fairly decent meal

Myrak was the dragon that was following us and we are being encircled by the dragonborn chasing us for the egg

## 12th of SolMun
We took care of the enemies around us and are being chased by a dragon, we make our way east to a Fort and there is a machine shooting things at the dragons wings and belly.

Been taken into and underground waiting area and are being taken to infirmary for healing and to be questioned by Lord Morgran

Met captain Derrick of the iron fort

Meruka goddess of education chapel making a communication through the mirror to sister Wind to check in on her she is OK but her and the witches are going back to the swamps, humans are taking up spots in the temple.

Had a lesson with Genevieve and Klink with help from Seb and now off to find a tavern to learn tips and trick as well as get a good place for drinks for Geoffrey

Make sure to have pipes to have liquid flowing through

Start in a small area sizeable carriage wagon 10 15 ft in length wooden metal covering metal panel that lifts see carpenter and see about suppliers look for towns with breweries

Look out for Amber gnome, possible business competitor

Went into the hags hatch and encountered 3 half elves and was enamoured by one of them called vex but was warned by elder sister that last one that courted her did a runner and was threatened to have their balls chopped off so slightly turned away from that but I have not courted since I was a teen, I am not used to this and think I need to somehow work my way towards doing this again
Erdan Mellenye is my stepfather 27th in line to the Mellenye House (one of the big five)

Adric Bronanvil is the dwarven noble I have explained the Klink murdering Lord Morgran situation and hopefully we will get to an agreeable solution over this.

Sister Wind is now mother Rotwood and matron of the clan

We have now managed to get Genevieve off the hook, getting Geoffrey off the hook but we need to speak with the air elementals to see about this being a kidnapping and Klink justifiably freeing them from their enslavement.

## 13th of SolMun
Tried to talk with one of the elementals but figured out they have been reduced to being a clear stone so seeing about getting the priestess to dispel this enchantment so I can actually speak with them.

Got Visstra to try dispel the stone but found out it needed to be broken open and release the elemental and now we are working to convince it to help us

They didn't, went to Lord Bronanvil explained what happened and been given a writ to observe investigation into Lord Morgran and been told that captain Derrick might try to kill Klink to enact justice.

With the court case being done I was accused of being part of a cult somehow to try and help Klinks case and I tried to ask for Geoffrey to come up

Didn't go well and the court has decided to offer him to work in the mines to live out his sentence

## 21st of SolMun
Time skip to a week and we have a red frog in black robes by the name of Chester asking if we are the crimson gears and they said simply "viva la revolution"
We have found out that Chester is quite murder happy and is a devout follower of the crimson King (Klink don't ever tell him that is his name) we are heading for one of the border towns to get some money making first watch for the Night, nothing occurred.

Hunted rabbits with Chester making way to border town called Starfall.

Met Archibald an ex college sorcerer who sells items has agreed to possibly sell four communication rocks for about 2000 gold

Found others at the bar green moot and spoke of the rocks and possible plan, might be taking the dragon egg to someone of elf folk and let them look after the egg

Eleanor (deep brown hair and traveller gear, tanned in skin high elf, child of Nephion (god of elves)) of the green moot served a drink called elder song and sorta flirted with her for a moment whether or not that leads to anything I don't know but it might be doubtful it will lead to anything, may as well shoot my shot.

I went for it and was told of the sage who can tell stories of the tree and I asked if Eleanor would accompany me in listening and translating the stories. I am to meet her at the green moot at red skies.

Great tree is called Galenhal

Went to a guild to see about how to set up an adventure party licence and they were less than helpful and I got more help from a child of Cynthia (goddess of the moon sibling of solace) by the name of Trilla (blue tiefling sorcerer) who offered up a possible job taking on a basilisk and helping find her old companions and earn 1000 gold. She seemed to have a lot of fun in riling me up even referring to me as an airhead, said it was meant as a joke but I still have a rough time trying to take things less seriously.

Met with Genevieve and Chester and there is a murder job going, not said if it is innocent or not and I'm having trouble with this, it goes against what I did  to ensure that criminals are brought to justice.. I can only hope whoever it is that they deserve it, meanwhile I am meeting my date.

We went to hear the stories at the tree we talked about our lives and she offered for me to play in some games and I joined in some dancing and sang and when I was about to kiss her Chester and Genevieve came along and interrupted the date but I escorted Eleanor home and on my way back to the carriage I spotted Trilla following me and confronted her, job still stands but she spoke about keeping an eye on me after the whole revolution and a red dragon being spotted nearby so we are being watched carefully, I was also told to watch my 2 companions carefully.

Met with gene and that and spoke about what was done and got a bit emotional during the time so now gotten a wee talk about what Geoffrey did for mother Rotwood and other activities, now questioning what I do in this group.

## 22nd of SolMun
It was then that Trilla appeared and spoke more about the job, we went to the library to read up on basilisk and decided on trying to trap the beast, we got to its lair and followed all the way to the back, it was then we discovered that there were 2 of them and they trapped us, ironic really

We managed to kill the 2 of them with no casualties but Geoff got a bit trauma cos one was frozen to death, we have used its oil to revivify her 3 companions  and get ourselves out of the cave. 

We got payment for the heads then had to go to a graveyard for the other bit of payment apparently (had to pretend to be married with Genevieve and I was cheating for some reason, was funny) 

Went to get rocky talky and passed out 3 to the others and went to get some fairy cakes with gene now just taking a cake to the elder

He has told us he is dying and gave a story about Isaac and me and gene performed a song and he passed away during the middle of it, we gave Fredrick the sad news and met with Chester and Geoffrey and are talking about getting Klink out of the mines (currently talking about learning dwarvish and disguising me as a thug under the name of Isaac Willow to get into chatting with the governor's agent)

Now have a tattoo work in progress on shoulder of a gear with a skull in the middle and have been given a shave on side of hair and beard has been made into a goatee, asked Geoffrey to see about clothes and Genevieve about a book on the dwarven language.

Had a chat with Chester about stars for a bit, he has some odd theories about them, makes me miss my son a lot more really.

Black trousers and doublet with red and yellow colouring, white scarf

Having drinks at the blue rat and getting an insight to the criminal underworld and heard more about the gruesome demise of Tristan, paid for some I formation on a lady that wants a dragon taken care of by the name of Vonda Agosto

Got my clothes clothes books so now reading with Chester to learn dwarvish

## 23rd of SolMun
Woke up in morning and cooked rabbits went for a swim in pond to get Chester who walked out as I went in, now just wandering to find Vonda

Been given a touch up on tattoo and been taught to swagger and have a charming but quiet sort of way of talking and be calmly threatening

Had a spar with Vonda and she is accepting our assistance in taking down Myrak the dragon that was chasing us before

Now gotten more cooking supplies as well as livestock and some leather armour, making our journey to the mountain and learned how to use my rifle efficiently, had a sparring match with Genevieve as she learned how to use a rapier.

Making a stop at the iron fort to request Klinks release in exchange for taking care of Myrak, Lord Bronanvil the new head of the dwarven clans has said he can't release him but could see about a meeting to discuss it and Genevieve requested seeing Klink to which he said it would be to the warden to decide

He was alright with us seeing him as long as he was being carefully watched by armed escort, we didn't refuse as we wanted to see him.. I wanted to see him again..

As we see him we chat and find out about his growing revolution within the mines as well, gene and he have been looking at each other  quietly at points so I'm guessing they are speaking telepathically and she took a stumble in the heels she was wearing and was helped by the warden and Klink said we shouldn't apologise to these bastards in his words.

## 1st of CynMar
Said farewell to klink and made way back into elevator was told to remember klink was on the 85th level and bronanvil is on the 8th

had a shoot at the range and a bath with bronanvils Mrs who has clued us in that in order for klink to be taken away without an uproar or chaos that he needed to "die" and I'm now going shopping with gene to get some clothes so we can have a meal, Geoffrey seems to have a plan in place

got some clothes in the middle of it klink called me on a rocky talky (gene managed to sneak her one over to him) and just felt good getting to hear from him again, now making way to elevator and waiting for gene.

had dinner with lady bronanvil and the others and we have discussed that we are going to try and say that lord bronanvil is a bit more tired and needs to give leadership to someone that can handle it (ie her) she has been given a tulip and I decided to go blow off some steam with a dwarf called bronn stone

came back after we both got smacked onto the ground and drank a good amount of drinks and now sleeping it off in my room.

woke to hearing that lord bronanvil has returned and has the results, he said he won't be released but may be moved to processing.

met with vonda and now making way to the mountains.

## 2nd of CynMar
making our way and learning some more dwarvish and picked up some water whilst at a spring, was given a shard that felt empty from Chester as he swam in the spring.

we have made bets at our campsite for the night to try and capture a big animal to bring back, we made wagers and I tracked a young directly to its cave, made several attempts to catch a young direwolf but failed and sustained many injuries in the attempt, went back and geoffrey gave me so praise for trying to go for it, I gave genevieve directions to it, maybe she might succeed but don't want her dying for it.

I worried for nothing, she caught it without even trying that hard... not bad, she did kill a dragon u wouldn't expect her to fail. she did better than I ever could, quite proud of her, I need to be better.

## 3rd of CynMar
Chester caught a bigger direwolf and we tried to hammer the stone into a deer that vonda caught and the stone appears to have taken life from it and dims a bit, Chester went  to do the dad direwolf but we protested we don't, only for Chester to do it anyway even though we tried to stop him, I attempted to keep it living but just made it suffer worse so put it out of its misery, the stone took its life but the deer life has disappeared, I dont condone what Chester did amd have given the soul stone to genevieve and said she is to keep it safe, right now my trust in Chester has diminished.

got deer prepped for dinner for a bit and vonda has spoken with me about how I just seemed to think I was in the right and that I wasn't respecting the group as a whole and I didn't want to hear more so I tried to cut her off to just give my head a moment but she continued calling me rude for doing so and I sat up ready to drive when gene gave me a talking to saying that i need to improve my people skills and hurt my head, we are now riding,

learning more dwarvish with gene and talking with her about apologising to vonda for treating her like a little girl and Chester about what transpired, giving him the stone back but the stone felt odd after being in the box with the dragon egg.

vonda apology went better and I revealed who I was before and got informed that Geoffrey may not want to help in the fight that he is reluctant to do so so wanting to make sure he is OK.

Chester apology was a bit more odd and it didn't feel as well done but he doesn't seem to be annoyed at me

## 6th of CynMar
making a stop at a stream for more water, gene is going off with Geoffrey to find some tulips and possibly veges, would be so much better for pur meals if they do but they made no promises

now helping Chester test the soul stone and see how it works, it just reminds me of klink quite a bit, he has now embedded it into the rapier klink won and we have 2 rabbits for eats

gene and Geoff have been gone for 2 hours and I tried calling Geoff to check on them but got static, I don't like this

fucked up the dinner but at least Geoffrey and gene are back safe though seemed that gene took a stumble, night is filled with dragon roars

## 7th of Cynmar

had breakfast and learning more dwarvish also did some exercises now on the road.

making way up mountains and gene found some apples and garlic has been excitedly talking about getting potatoes and lemons, it is nice to see her being excited about this.

we have had to leave the carriage and most of the animals behind with Geoffrey as we take the horses, I summoned my horse named Lady

zenimir of the clan sinnodel (hunter = Wood elf)
was guarding the valley pass with his children and he has offered us to chat with the leader of his village, Chester is wanting to kill them, doing my best to keep him from going murder happy

we spoke with the elder who was curious as to pur reasons for going to take care of the dragon, i gave as best an explanation without revealing too much and she convened with the gods who have said that the dragon will leave one way or another, so we have permission to go after it, zenimir is leading us towards the dragon for now.

we made camp for the night and were awoken by a pair of burnt bears which we defeated swiftly with a few scrapes and cuts

## 8th of Cynmar

we slept in to catch up on time lost so we can be fully rested before encountering mirak
We saw dwarf airships against the untainted and one has fallen into the lake, vonda is going ahead to scout the cave where mirak resides whilst we go to see if there are any survivors and whilst in conversation with one of the dwarves they said something that made freeze up.. I felt like I was a small child again witnessing my real father leave this plane of existence..

Gene managed to smack me back into the present and we have helped give communications to flight lieutenant Frederick to get air transport for airman caleb ander but said it would be some time whilst the dragon was alive, we are making way to vonda.

We are still making plans but we did manage to get some explosives, Chester is plotting with vonda on how we can utilise them and how we can take care of it but Chester is adamant about getting the dwarf lords to renegotiate our deal

We have fought against mirak and just managed to kill it after it damaged us greatly and we are in the works of descaling it for armour for the carriage, horses and me, maybe klink as well.

## 9th of Cynmar

Vonda and I are transporting some of the scales to Geoffrey and Chester has given us the great news that lady bronanvil will be releasing klink in exchange for the death of the dragon.
Been advised by Geoffrey to stay out of the Daadenrian empire after having killed a second dragon. Geoffrey is going to get the rest of the scales whilst I collected the goats

10th cynmar

Making our way away from the mountains back towards the iron fortress again


## 11th of CynMar

Met up with Archibald who genevieve gave the essence of the dragon mirak to and Chester is showing the soul stone to him to see what it is.

It is called a Genesis shard, witches mainly keep it, when God's toom the first step on the mortal plane it created a crystal of unknown size and nature filled with extra planar energy. One klink brought to archive was more carved, the chips allow energy to escape whereas carved one keeps energy.

Builders society has more it seems after the calamity.

Tried cooking dragon meat which didn't go great, asked Archibald about making a relieving sign into the stones we have.

Analysis is a nice beachfront holiday destination but is in daadendrien

Some people are rumoured to have Genesis shards but unwilling to part with them

## 14th of CynMar

Finished learning dwarven

## 15th of CynMar

arrived back at the iron fortress and we are told that I we want klink we are to come to the gutters in Elemvault at our earliest convenience

Adric gave us klinks arm saying he and a few others were killed in a mining accident and we were offered beds for the night, when I get the chance I'm going to get klink back and if they try to keep my boy from me I'll make them regret it.

## 16th of CynMar

Been kicked out of the iron fortress exiled the works, told the Lord and lady they can ask me for help if they wish but we bring chaos and death whenever we  appear 

Made an agreement with Geoffrey about Chester and he is proud of me, I feel slightly sick but also feel like it isn't the wrong thing I am doing.. bit conflicted


## 23rd of CynMar 

Box is smoking and kicking about.. 

We now have a baby gold dragon that is now  called lizzy, not certain 

We encountered a young thief who seemed to be a lording but is a bit of a brat and Chester murdered him and before anything else could be done as genevieve told me to hold Chester goeffrey fired a shot at him and Chester has jumped off into the trees.

Kid has now wandered toward village and now we are making way for klink 

## 24th of cynmar 

House selencia guards are asking us where we are heading and about a boy called Michael we assume it was the same one that got murdered 

Had an interesting conversation with genevieve about her past, how her mother had made jewellery and sold them from a stall, she also showed me some scars from her past but won't elaborate on it but I have promised her to help take care of whoever did that to her 

## 8th of mormun 

We have arrived to Elemvault, me, Geoffrey and genevieve had discussed weird dreams we had though hers sounded amazing, it was to do with a ship that could take you to the stars themselves. Geoffrey has been invited to play chess and wound up naked,in involved a purple giraffe, a baby sized Griffin and a reverse centaur. 

We have entered the city and the stalls are closed so we are making our way to find out where klink is. 

Letting genevive and geoffrey get him whilst I keep dragon safe at the temple, Paladin Gregory has been made the head of the temple and has heard of a lot of what has happened but I kept genevieves escapades hidden 

Also told him and showed him the golden dragon which he asked has not been born in a millenia and is now in a state of shock 

Reunited with my son klink and am all the happier for seeing him, genevieve has wandered off for a walk whilst Geoffrey has disappeared. Klink and I have discussed the scales, the genesis shard as well as the dragon and what to do with them, I would like to take them to the witches in the swamp homeland, also been informed that we now have a network and a revolution in the name of the crimson gears due to klinks followers named pages and keyleth. 

Played about with the dragon and fed it some raw rabbit which it cooked itself, asked Gregory about getting a book on draconic language 

He has taken me to the tower to speak with mother rotwood through a mirror who has advised that taking the dragon to the swamps isn't the best course of action as the dragons if they sense it there would come after it in force, the city is safer but to just keep moving it about, also told that telling Gregory about it wasn't great as he is recently the head. Discussed plans on establishment and upgrading the temple also found out that Chester is trying to infiltrate the iron fort and I gave warning that he was doing that hopefully they are safe.

Geoffrey is upset his tulips were trampled, genevieve had dream date (actually dream date not real I think) now going to get something special as well as lemons, put down a deposit to collect at end of the day. 

Going to speak with the dragon diplomat varim about the dragon and about a dragonic language book.. not sure how this conversation will go. 

Actually went rather well, been advised to keep dragon underground or if I wanted to keep it safe take it to the heart of elven realm which is north been warned that to be careful as it goes into the feywild, find wood elf to guide us to elven realm. 

Apparently I have now got the temple as a stronghold that jas been given the go ahead by Gregory and I have a swordmaster pledging themselves to me. 

Gnome swordmaster by the name of Nim who I served with in the war who wished to better my sword manship and help look after the temple 

Gave genevieve the earrings and she seemed to have liked them quite a bit, feel good about getting them for her. 

## 17th of mormun 

During my 8 days been investigating 2 murders and earned some coins and resting whilst learning some dragonic, also had some fun helping genevieve perform at the tavern.

Kain a humanoid wrapped in bandages is now joining our stronghold. 

Got into contact with a witch to ask about protection spells against teleportation and was led to college of storms in town to see about hiring a mage 

Laycien laidon which means silver frond is chatting with us about it. 

Been asked to look for the scientist ramus nightborne to see about runes for the high elf mage laycien. Only to visit during daytime and not beyond the threshold of his home. 

Briefly met Trilla the sorcerer supreme (likely a vanity title) the blue tiefling again who was entertained that I had gotten in the makes front door and I offered a possible job and a possible meal. Going to see about picking up potatoes and some gravy, might see about some pork and bacon. 

Did so and made way back to the temple though genevieve is heading to the library for a bit, hoping she will have fun whilst I cook up some lovely dinner. 

Meeting up with klink and dragon first to discuss laycien as well as read dragonic. 

Genevieve and the dragon were messing with me for a week, granted it was well played but I told the dragon to sit and roll over so many times.
Been advised by Geoffrey to head to a tavern called the ball where there is an arena sort of area for people to knock the shit on of each other, should be fun. He and genevieve have went off into the city to do who knows what but they will be rejoining us later think. 

Met with Gregor, spoke of halberk overhill son of Lord morgren asking for me by name, this should go well 

Was advised by a grieving son to steer clear of general Eugene if he does seek me out. 

Taking klink out to the ball but he has stopped by a rundown shop and a couple of folks said they were the governors men and were wanting something the previous owner had, they are thinking of me as dumb, probably for the best I am not the brightest. 

Got to the ball and had a mock fight with my son, in it I might have went a bit far in performance insulting him whilst he was a gnome saying I've taken shits bigger than him and for some weird reason heard someone say that I should wish me a new face, I lost the fight intentionally, got a free drink off an elderly chap that bet against me and suggested I go to a clinic to check my wounds, I'm just making my way back to the regular parts of the city and have healed my own wounds. 

Caught up with klink and Geoffrey but they seemed to be having a heated argument. 

Got back to the temple and heard that genevieve was sitting outside the gate for a time.. I think everyone could use something nice for the night so I made some strawberry tarts. 

Geoffrey wasnt in his room so I left a tart and a note saying if he wants to talk about anything I would be there 

Tried genevieves guest room and she wasn't there, left a tart and a note saying I heard she was outside the temple gate for a time and I was hoping she was OK and asking if it was anything to do with what happened with Geoffrey and klink. Whilst being there I figured out the riddle that Solace was puzzled with, if the candle was lit then the meal was already cooked means that the answer was already there, got some warm glows from the flames around hoping that means Solace is content, I asked him to help watch over my friends. 

Going to find klink and he is not in his room... I don't leave a note but I do leave a tart for him. 

I sit in my office and look through the yuan ti book and see about scars and the more pain given maximises more power taken from the soul, if genevieve had these same marks does that mean she was meant to be a sacrifice, if so as it a botched one or did something come of this as she is still alive and have snakish scales....
I'll ask her about this in the morning, just want to figure out how best to go about it. 

The book burned and there was a demonic face with a laugh about it as it disappeared.. I need to ask genevieve. 

Wound up cooking up bacon for the others and having a mental chat with genevieve about the book, she seems to be open about her being a yuan ti (I know right) and what happened with her, but she seemed to to think the trader had something to do with the face in the fire, also said about a trader giving genevieve a pendant that granted her her warlock powers but didn't say about the patron that gave it, its a bit concerning but I trust genevieve with my life, I want to help her as much as I can. 

Dreamed about the world that Solace inhabits and he spoke to me about a World made above the abyss by one of Solace siblings and angels went down to there to face the evil creatures and have been turned into devil's, I've asked Solace to watch over my friends and inquired about what I should do, he said that if I wish to deal with the gold dragon that I should head north, I I wanted to find out more about the yuan ti mystery and the creature from the deadzone head west, I was also said that if I wanted to avoid those to head east but there is something equally challenging that direction 

## 18th of Mormun 

I woke up to see the letter L burned into my pillow.. I can only guess that this might be the creature from the deadzone, I will figure out more about them

Asked pages about looking into necromancy and yuan ti to get to the bottom of the life force being used for a devil's purposes, been advised to not look into it and take last night as a warning sign 

Spoken to Geoffrey about keeping an eye on genevieve and making sure she is OK, also offered to help him get what he needs for planting. He advised me to get wolfsbane and 
ask klink about sulphuric acid 

Got klink to help me with the acid and apologised for the mock fight last night
Also purchased 1 kilo of wolfsbane, used 1 platinum for it when it cost 5 gold so next one should be free
Making way back to the temple and past by gregor spoke about the devil burning a book and he is furious with me cause I didn't notify him sooner and he is working on temple protections. 

Got to talking with gene for a little bit and I just feel like I made things weird and apparently I am confusing a lot of folk with the fact I am helping with Geoffrey's tulips, probably not the best thing for me to do but I am wanting to help a friend at least.
Surina is name of golden dragon and klink has called a meeting and it has resulted in us moving north to find the elves so we are taking keyleth with us to get to the city 

Been advised by gregor to keep klink under wraps and give better pseudonyms 

## 20th of Mermun 

Passing the drowned bay  and visiting the governor 
Told about numerous robed figures inquiring about crimson gears been asked to look into South of border in camp
Large wide and muscular with taloned feet 

Investigating a mining camp and are now ambushed by 2 robed fires one with withe scales and another green scales.

We managed to dispatch them and caused a cave in in the mines where the rest of them remain, now maijng way to govenors House to get some rest and report back. 

Relayed information and he escorted me to my room and said my elven father was asking after me out of curiosity and said I should take a breath and remember to look toward the sun. We talked a little about my mother, I do miss her and would like to settle down after our business and maybe relax for a while. 

## 21st of Mermun 

Woken to breakfast and making journey on ferry when we spotted archives shack and have asked him about making new enchantments to rings instead of stones he has asked us to aquire a cut gem from a roderick ironwood.
