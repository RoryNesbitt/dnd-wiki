# Daadenrian republic synopsis By professor Benjamin Eccart of Elemvault university
## History
- Fallen from the heavens
History on this island is scarce at best, given its lack of written documentation in the form of glyths or pre-human historic writing on Gaia.
Still, it possesses its many wonders, especially in the form of, what we know to be, the oldest of the living sentient races on Ter-Vale (our world).

What we know from word of mouth, passed down by many generations of our elven allies, is that the dragons plumeted to the earth in great balls of fire, not long after their initial awakening.  Ten such extra terrestrial objects in total, each landing on impressive mountain top peaks far to the north of the elven forrests.  

We are led to believe each of these objects contained a mother dragon and many eggs.  Neither the dragons themselves or the elves have commented any further unfortunately.  We can however date their arrival to sometime between seven thousand sixhundred, and nine thousand sixhundred years before the calamity.  This predates the founding of the great human empire by at least five millenia!
