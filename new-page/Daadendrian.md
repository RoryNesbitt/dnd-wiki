# Daadenrian republic synopsis By professor Benjamin Eccart of Elemvault university
## History
- Fallen from the heavens
History on this island is scarce at best, given its lack of written documentation in the form of glyths or pre-human historic writing on Gaia.
Still, it possesses its many wonders, especially in the form of, what we know to be, the oldest of the living sentient races on Ter-Vale (our world).

What we know from word of mouth, passed down by many generations of our elven allies, is that the dragons plumeted to the earth in great balls of fire, not long after their initial awakening.  Ten such extra terrestrial objects in total, each landing on impressive mountain top peaks far to the north of the elven forrests.  

We are led to believe each of these objects contained a mother dragon and many eggs.  Neither the dragons themselves or the elves have commented any further unfortunately.  We can however date their arrival to sometime between seven thousand sixhundred, and nine thousand sixhundred years before the calamity.  This predates the founding of the great human empire by at least five millenia!

- Immortal's clash and titans rise
As is the nature of pre existing civilisations meeting their new neighbours, tensions were high when the Avariel elves (wingged elves if you believe the tales) first encountered the gargantuan scaled reptilians who sprung forth from their smokey remains.  
Needless to say, we know enough about dragon and draconic culture to see how their first encounter commenced and concluded.  In fire and terrified screams.

The children of Nephion were both confused and scared.  Not only did their kin not return to their woodlan realms, but they also perrished in the first unnatural deaths of their history. In the early days, the elves were young, impulsive and very new to conflict.  They could not predict the horror's and desolation of war.

Most childrens stories and Bardic tales, tell us of a thousand year blood war between the young elves and the territorial Dragons. A pretty exageration most likely to inspire and instill wonder in younger hearts.  Knowledge of their past is either forgotten or changed to suit certain narratives.  Two things are certain, their war brought about the birth of humanoid draconic warriors, and the death of the Avariel elves

- The treaty of the Immortals
As is the nature of every pointless conflict on our beautiful world, much like a dusk must meet the dawn, the water touches the sand.  The war had to come to an end.  Young they were, the elves impressed and even earned the admiration of the dragons.  Whom addored strength above all.  Under the belief that there are only two existences in this life.  Prey and hunter.  

A moot was established by the weary elders of each race of dragon and elf.  Hear was signed, in spirit, an agreement that neither elf nor dragon would invade the honoured lands of either.  If any conflict arose, it would be between two indivudals and not a collective ideology.  Queen Geruda the great golden dragon, and Tanan, chieften (or king) of the elven races, declared the fghting done.

Knowledge was exchanged between the two respective peoples, the dragonborn were allowed to remain and would become the representatives of their masters to the smaller races of Varius.  There of course, have been the odd spout between their people over the mellenia.  Peace has won out every time. 

- Formation of the republic
An interesting name given to their respected territories by the Human settelers of Ferosia.  The dragonborn are recognised as a kind of diplomatic collection of city states that follow the doctrines and ideologies of the Dragons.  

In reality, the dragons have never drawn such lines on any map.  To them, they own whatever they can cover with their own wings and power.  The republic comes from the various mortal city states that exist below the mountains.  On the surface, there are dozens, of not hundreds, of city states that dot the landscape of what we refer to as Daadenria. Largely made up of the lizard folk, who are taller, leaner and in greater numbers than those of the dragonborn.  Over the last few centuries though, humans, elves, dwarvs, orcs and more have established city states in their land.

These city states pledge alliegence to the dragons alone for their protection against rivale states or even invading enemies.  Raiders and bandits, thieves and highwaymen.  This is how they have established one of the most successful nations on varius.

- Honour and respect
Legend's have a way of bending facts and fiction to suit myths.  The dragons do not recognise boarders or flags. Dragonborn however have developed their own society in the thousands of years since their creation.  They have created a very flexible cast system, which anyone, be they dragonborn or other, can ascend or descend depending on their abilities to strive, advance, evolve, claim, and retain their honour, repuation and worldly possessions. 

A good example is Amafrey of the saphire riders.  A collection of dragon riders from every colour and mountain kingdom, who represents their union and desire for peace and security.  

She is a human a city state far to the east, closer to the leased land of Anakis.  A tributary, volunteered of course, in exchange for draconic protection from orc raiders.  From a child of eighteen years who showed promise in combat, leadership and charisma.  Her dragonlord, Varim (the now ambassador of the republic) took her to the chamber of dragon spawn, where an egg responded to her touch and hatched.  

This granted her a reputation and earned respect from the Brass dragonborn community.  She soared through their cast system and now stands only a few positions under the dragon prince Shiala her self.  

The same oppotunities are not universal, depending on draconic blood type of course. But the principle stands.  Those who are strong enough to be the hunter, will stand and prosper.  

- The civil war of titans and cloud breakers
Every one of a reasonable and reputable education knows of the catastrophic blood war that near broke the dragonborn society.  A millenia again, some one thousand and fourtysix to be exact, the Cromatic bloodlines alliaed under Karanas (the great black) and Adamak (the great red)  to exliminate the Golden bloodline of Geruda.  These last three of the first ten dragons would come to blows and end nearly eight thousand years of peace.  

The war was swift and precise.  Planned in advance for what easily could have been many centuries by Adamak and Karanas.  The golden city and its allies among their metalic kin, were caught completely unaware.  

A collection of cromatic dragon and dragonborn joined forces to attack the largest of the dragon kingdoms, the golden city, while the rest of their people launched distracted conflicts against their metalic breatheren.  In a single night, now called the final sunset of Geruda, the city and its people were raised to the ground.  The great golden dragon her self was killed in flight miles from the city.  It is suspected that not even the royal golden family escape the inferno.  

since that night, the red dragon's and their dragonborn have lead the council of princes without true contest.  Remarkably however, an unforseen consequence plagues their kind to this day.  Not a single dragon egg has been laid by any mother in the last meillenia.  Meaning they are now technically considered an endangered and dying race.  They are, regardless, far from weak.

- The Greater dragons
little is known about this subspecies of dragon other than they are exceptionally old and, unlike their ancient counterparts, do not need to slumber and wait for their food sources to grow for centuries at a time. None are quite sure what sustains them.  The only certainty is that their power may rival that of the archfey of the feyrealm.  Evidence concludes this hypothisis as with their collective magical abilities, they enacted a godly ritual that created life!  The very dragonborn we know and see today are the product of their power.  

Their names have been lost over the millenia, but we still know three of the first ten dragons who fell to Ter-vale pre human history.  Adamak, the great red, the first red dragon.  Karanas, the great black, the first black dragon.  Lastly, Geruda, the great gold, the first golden dragon.  Of these three however, the last we know to have lived was karanas, who without the guidence and protection of Geruda, struck a mighty blow against the now old and aged elves of Gascade. A foolish mistake which cost them their fortress, their people and their life.  Last sighted as it was carried in heavy black chains by the old elven king, Taravhul.  

it is now believed that none of the Greater dragons remain living.  A relief to most who may wish to challenge the power of daadenria.  A concern to some people such as my self, who in a strange way, mourn the loss of such magnificent creatures.  We will never see their like again.
